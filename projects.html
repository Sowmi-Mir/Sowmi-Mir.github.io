    <h2>Governance & Audit Playbook</h2>
    <p>Sowmitri developed a comprehensive internal document associated with digitial risk management while addressing roles such as CISO, Audit Personnel, Data Personnel, and Business Leaders. The playbook covered several crucial topics to cybersecurity governance including but not limited to: AI Ethics, Metadata Governance, Intellectual Property, and Secure Software Development Practices. All of these topics were discussed while maintaining a focus on holistic, policy driven governance in an enterprise acquisition environment. </p>

    <h2>ICS Exploitation Project</h2>
    <p>In this academic project, Sowmitri targeted a virtual chemical plant and its boiler in a dual phase exploitation. The first phase saw Sowmitri attempt to gain access to the Chemical Plant's Human-Machine Interface (HMI). After several manual attempts to breach the HMI login page, Sowmitri utilized the third-party software Burp Suite Community. This software allowed him to specifically target the HMI login page and lauch a brute force attack using a text document of potential passwords as the payload. After approximately 15 minutes, the third-party software determined the correct password and Sowmitri gained access to the HMI. The second exploitation phase involved the detonation of a virtual boiler connected to the Chemical Plant. After several failed attempts, Sowmitri utilized a Kali Linux Virtual Machine to execute a malicious Python script. This Python script targeted the read/write register of boilers associated Programmable Logic Controler (PLC). The end result was destruction of the boiler which was designated as mission success. After the completion of each phase, Sowmitri wrote a highly detailed report containing all steps taken regardless of success. </p>
