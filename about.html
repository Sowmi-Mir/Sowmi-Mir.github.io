    <p>Sowmitri Miryala is a double graduate of The University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas). In 2021, Sowmitri graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Criminology from the school of Economics, Political, and Policy Sciences (EPPS). Sowmitri's original plan post graduation was to attend medical school to become a Medical Examiner. After recieving a conditional acceptance to St. George's University of Medicine, Sowmitri had reservations about the past and future cost of this career. Ultimately, he decided against pursuing this career and made a pivot to Cybersecurity. In the Summer of 2023, Sowmitri decided to return to UT Dallas and enroll in a Master's program for Cybersecurity, Technology, and Policy through the school of EPPS. As of May 2025, Sowmitri holds a MS in Cybersecurity, Technology, and Policy. Sowmitri now focuses his time on Cybersecurity Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and aims to become a policy writer or internal auditor in the private sector. Sowmitri continues to hone his skills in these areas with hands-on projects both technical and non-technical in nature. The technical projects help him understand what cybersecurity engineers require in order to build secure systems. The non-technical projects allow him to keep up-to-date on current industry standards. Sowmitri is a firm believer in the idea that proper policy and governance starts with those that build the foundation such as SOC Analysts. This portfolio highlights my work in security operations, risk frameworks, and digital governance projects.</p>
