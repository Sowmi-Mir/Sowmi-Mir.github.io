      <h1>Security & Usablity</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>A critical junction between cybersecurity and human-computer interaction (HCI), the idea of merging usability with cybersecurity did not exist as a concept until much later in the era of computing. In the early days, computers were exclusively used for computing large data sets that requrired the highest forms of security. Based on this purpose, computers only served use for experts in the field who were well situated with the navigation of a computer system, ergo, they did not need help with general operations.</p>
      <p>The idea of usability started appearing when computer systems left the realm of complex computing. By this point in time, computers were being leveraged by the average user to complete tasks with the use of specifically designed software. However, the problem lied in the level of security that was still playing a part. These specialized software were being developed with security in mind with no consideration for ease of use. When provided to users, they felt that the security measures in place were so stringent, it made the software too difficult to use, especially for daily tasks. One key security feature that hindered usability was when users set up passwords. Most of these softwares requrired users to set complex passwords to protect their accounts. The problem was that these passwords were often so complex that users wrote them down on paper effectively dismissing the point of virtual security measures.</p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Given that security measures often hindered usability, a new perspective was innovated. Design security measures that agreed with user operations. The simplest example of this perspective was the usage of encryption on the back end of software when users created passwords. Instead of requiring users to create overly complex passwords that they would not remember on their own, developers included concepts such as salting and hashing while simultaneously requiring user passwords to be a certain length, have capitalization, and have common special characters. One example of this is a user setting the worst possible password of "abcd1234." Instead of "abcd1234" the user might be guided to make their password "Abcd1@#$." When this password was sent to the server in its current plaintext, pre-configured algorithms could assign one or more characters to the end of user generated password (i.e., "Abcd1@#$" -> "Abcd1@#$Y6g2" (salting)) and then transform the entire string of characters into a seemingly random string of characters (hashing). While the base password was not so complex that users couldn't remember, the hidden operations that users did not see allowed their accounts to become more secure while preserving their usability of the software.</p>
      <p>In our modern day, security and usability have become dual priorties of cybersecurity. Now with the introduction of additional services such as Multi-Factor Authentication and password managers, users have more stronger virtual security, while still maintaining their ease of use.</p>
