    <h2>Vanguard College Prep</h2>
    <p>After using the company's services to prepare for my ACT examination and eventual application to The University of Texas at Dallas, Sowmitri Miryala came back to the organization as an Intern from June 2017 to January 2020. During this time, Sowmitri's roles involved producing custom workbooks and practice problems based on prior ACT exams as well as proctoring students taking practice exams. The last year spent at the organization, Sowmitri achieved the role of Executive Director of Volunteer Services. This role, in addition to the previous responsibilities, saw Sowmitri manage new interns and oversee their work.</p>

    <h2>Cyber Defense Center at Blackswan Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>Sowmitri started his role as Intern at Cyber Defense Center (CDC) which is the non-profit arm of the cybersecurity company Blackswan Cybersecurity. Starting the year 2024 as one of four interns, Sowmitri took on various projects both non-technical and technical in nature. Currently, Sowmitri serves as Volunteer Intern Coordinator and oversees current and incoming interns as they progress in both their work and cybersecurity careers.</p>
      <h3>White Paper</h3>
      <p>Sowmitri's first project saw him write an extensive white paper that proposed the building of a Cyber Criminal Profiling System. This project was chosen for two main reasons. The first is that Sowmitri's background in higher education in Criminology saw him learn about several methods to prevent the occurrence of crime. If these methods saw physical use cases, then Sowmitri believed with some more work, these can also be applied to the virtual sectors of crime. The second reason was his inspiration by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Behavioral Science Unit (now called Behavioral Analysis Unit) in their work to develop a profiling system for serial offenders. Sowmitri believes that if a profiling system based on why offenders commit crimes can be developed, then the same method can be applied to virtual crime.</p>

      <h3>Internal Organization Policy</h3>
      <p>Sowmitri has a main interest in developing cybersecurity policy for organizations in order to strengthen security posture. Based on this belief, Sowmitri started drafting an extensive and comprehensive policy document. Before Sowmitri started, some policies were already in place; however, they only applied to the internship program offered by CDC. There were two goals in mind when developing these policies; improve internal operational efficiency and strengthen security posture. Based on these goals, Sowmitri authored policies covering several topics including but not limited to Software and Network Usage, Acceptable Use Associated with Generative AI, Data Management, and Document Handling. Sowmitri worked directly with Blackswan Cybersecurity's head of Human Resources Gina Moore to review previous and newly developed policies to ensure compliance with regulations and insurance/legal teams.</p>

    <h3>Job Descriptions</h3>
    <p>One project Sowmitri participated in alongside the Program Director Kyla Saylor was the development and updating of cybersecurity related job descriptions. This project saw Sowmitri align current job descriptions with appropriate elements by utilizing the NICE/NICCs Framework and the Cyber Career Pathways Tool provided by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. This project served as an in depth approach to understanding the different roles available to cybersecurity professionals. It involved aligning the descriptions with specific elements such as Task Statements, Capability Indicators, and Common Relationships.</p>

    <h3>Cybersecurity Course</h3>
    <p>A project showcasing Sowmitri's leadership was the development of a comprehensive cybersecurity course aimed at graduating high school seniors and those wishing to enter the field of cybersecurity. This project saw Sowmitri lead several interns as they created a vast array of curriculum and their internal elements such as documents, PowerPoints, and lectures. The course contained key topics such as risk & vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, ethical hacking, cloud environments, secure software development, and digital forensics. The goal of this project was to provide newcomers an introductory course to cybersecurity that exposed them to several different roles. Based on this exposure, new cybersecurity professionals could retain a better understanding of what roles best fit them and where they should focus their efforts.</p>
