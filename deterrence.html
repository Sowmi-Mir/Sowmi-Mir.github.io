      <h1>Deterrence Theory</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Originally proposed by Cesare Beccaria in his work An Essay on Crimes and Punishment, deterrence theory has been continuously maintained as a keystone of the modern era for the purposes of justice. Since its acceptance into society as a way to deal with crime, it can also be found in several other institutions including but not limited to: education, workplace, and cybersecurity. Deterrence theory aims to reduce the recurrence of crime (recidivism) through the strategic use of punishment and does this by relying on the facets of severity, certainty, and celerity.</p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Deterrence theory works by utilizing three main parts. Severity refers to how severe the punishment is in comparison to the crime. For example, the heinous crime of murder almost always carries a sentence of 20 years behind bars in jurisdictions with strict sentencing laws. Essentially, the more horrible and socially condemned a crime, the more severe the punishment. Certainty refers to the probability of the punishment being carried out. Sticking with out example of murder, most would agree the chance of receiving a long prision sentence is guaranteed. Celerity refers to the speed at which a punishment follows the commission of the crime. In most cases where a person is accused of murder alongside corroborating evidence, the time between their horrible actions and seeing the inside of a cell is only a few months. By using severity, probability, and speediness, the belief is that most crimes can be prevented by using past punishments as examples to discourage future offenders..</p>
      <p>While this does work for a majority of crimes, there are some crimes where the deterrence theory fails to reduce the crime rate and instead we see an increase in occurrence. In the Criminology and Criminal Justice community, this is commonly referred to as the Brutalization Theory.</p>

      <h2>Brutalization Theory</h2>
      <p>Commonly seen in effect with crimes that render capital punishment as a proposed deterrent, the brutalization theory posits that a combination of decreased certainty and celerity leads to the occurrence of more crimes. For the unaware, capital punishment is commonly referred to as the death penalty, and serves as the most extreme punishment that can be carried out when seeking justice for a crime. While many think that the fear of death alone can influence people to not commit heinous crimes such as murder of a police officer, the fact that the probability of the punishment being carried out in a timely manner hurts the deterrent effect of the punishment. In the last several years, while many capital punishment sentences have been handed out, a majority of these convicted individuals remain alive behind bars for up to 20 years before being executed. The longer that it takes for the punishment to be carried out also increases the chance their sentence will be reversed to just life in prison. This combination in turn decreases the deterrent effect and actually increases the chance for future crime to occur.</p>
      <p>The reason for the increase in future crime is due to how the punishment is perceived by law abiding citizens in society. In the simplest way possible, what is essentially happening is that an individual who murders a police officer may spend decades in a federal institution, receiving basic needs like food and shelter while awaiting execution. This delay can unintentionally undermine the perceived severity and certainty of the punishment. This uncertainty for severe punishment is seen by potential criminals as the idea that committing a bad enough crime will allow them to be taken care of at the expense of others.</p>
